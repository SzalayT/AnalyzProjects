For this project, I will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

I have 6 countries data from 2000 to 2015. 

My goal is to understand that is there any realtionship between this two element or not. I'll visualizing these datas with seaborn and Matplot Python dictironies and hopefully this will help to understand the relationship. 

Finally i'll make a "blogpost" where i'll summarizing my findings.


##Data 

In the file we have four columns. Country, Year, Life Exp., GDP

Country and Year, this two will help us to labeling the datas and the visualizations. 

Life Exp. -> this is a integer and its shows the life expentancy at birth int the given year.

GDP -> this is an integer too. Its not clerifide but i think this shows the GPD in $ in the given year na din the given country.


##Analyze

* Look for any missing value in the dataset
* First some summarizing statistics abaout the GDP in the different countries and the Life Exp. in the different countrires, separately. 
* Find the best graph or visualization to see how GPD and Life Exp. relate to each other. 
* Based on these findigs we can create a Hypotesis and we can test it. 
* Summaraizing all the findings. 

Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
What is the distribution of that life expectancy?



i'll do a tabluea presentation too abaout this dataset.
